For V1.0:
 * skip data tracks, random play (needed feature: playlists)
 * mixer support (i.e. press volume button, and the think becomes a mixer -
   press cd button, and it will be the cdrom player).

And then:
 * integration of X-Resources for configuration purposes (that will take some
   time -- I will first need to buy some X-Programming-Manual ;-) )
 * cddb lookups + scroll text display
 * better configurability of the display (via XPM-extensions -- until now you
   can only change the look of the thing, but the positions and sizes must
   stay fixed).
 * cd-changer (I can't test this because I don't have such a thing)
 * sound-file-player
