This is the original TODO list written by Oliver Graf:

 - WindowMaker Application Menu integration (if I get the test app to
   run ;-) )
 - integration of X-Resources for configuration purposes (that will take some
   time -- I will first need to buy some X-Programming-Manual ;-) )
 - better configurability of the display (via XPM-extensions -- until now you
   can only change the look of the thing, but the positions and sizes must
   stay fixed).
 - cddb lookups + scroll text display
 - cd-changer (I can't test this because I don't have such a thing)
 - sound-file-player
 - spectrum analyzer

Since Oliver is no longer supporting or maintaining WMRack, this list
may or may not bear any resemblance to actual plans.  The new maintainer
(that's me, Chris Waters) will need some time to consider his options.

I also have at least one item to add:

- Enhance portability (not so Linux specific).  Note, as of v1.4, this
  is at least _partially_ accomplished, with the addtion of
  experimental support for Solaris and FreeBSD.
