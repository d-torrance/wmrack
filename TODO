 - WindowMaker Application Menu integration (if I get the test app to
   run ;-) )
 - integration of X-Resources for configuration purposes (that will take some
   time -- I will first need to buy some X-Programming-Manual ;-) )
 - better configurability of the display (via XPM-extensions -- until now you
   can only change the look of the thing, but the positions and sizes must
   stay fixed).
 - cddb lookups + scroll text display
 - cd-changer (I can't test this because I don't have such a thing)
 - sound-file-player
 - spectrum analyzer
