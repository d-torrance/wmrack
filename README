wmrack 1.3

The WindowMaker Sound Control Panel by Oliver Graf
Currently maintained by Chris Waters <xtifr@users.sourceforge.net>
See http://wmrack.sourceforge.net for the latest news and updates.


DESCRIPTION:
------------
WMRack is a Dock/Wharf applet which gives you complete control over
your CDROM, the Mixer and hopefully in the future to other sound related
stuff (feel free to send suggestions).

It's main advantage is the high configurability, which will let you specify
different looks for the window at startup.

CD-Functions:
 * Display Track and Time (remaining/to-go, track/total)
 * Play, Pause, Stop, Eject, Load, Track +/-, Fast Fore-/Back-ward
 * Display of total tracks and length when a new CD is loaded
 * random play, skip data tracks, play lists

Mixer Functions:
 * startup options for initial volume
 * control all your mixer devices
 * control balance
 * change record sources

INSTALLATION:
-------------
First you need to configure the whole package with:

./configure (see './configure --help' for options)

Now you can make a link in XPM to the style you want compiled into
WMRack using 'ln -s A.style standart.style' or do nothing for the
default.

After this a 'make' will compile WMRack and a 'make install' will
install it.


USAGE:
------
Look into the manpage for supported options and functions.

Easily swallowed by dock (use the --withdrawn option).

Putting wmrack into AfterStep Wharf:
*Wharf WMRack nil Swallow "wmrack" wmrack &

Oliver may no longer support the program, but if you'd like to tell him
that you appreciate his work, you can email ograf@fga.de

HISTORY:
--------
Basically this thing borrowed much from WorkBone, ascd and asmixer. But in
the progress of work, almost any part that was stolen, has been rewritten,
restructured, and overworked.
