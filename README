DESCRIPTION:
------------
WMRack is a Dock/Wharf applet which gives you complete control over
your CDROM, the Mixer and hopefully in the future to other sound related
stuff (feel free to send suggestions).

It's main advantage is the high configurability, which will let you specify
different looks for the window at startup.

CD-Functions:
 * Display Track and Time (remaining/to-go, track/total)
 * Play, Pause, Stop, Eject, Load, Track +/-, Fast Fore-/Back-ward
 * Display of total tracks and length when a new CD is loaded
 * random play, skip data tracks, play lists

Mixer Functions:
 * startup options for initial volume
 * control all your mixer devices
 * control balance
 * change record sources

INSTALLATION:
-------------
First you need to configure the whole package with:

./configure (see './configure --help' for options)

Now you can make a link in XPM to the style you want compiled into
WMRack using 'ln -s A.style standart.style' or do nothing for the
default.

After this a 'make' will compile WMRack and a 'make install' will
install it.


USAGE:
------
Look into the manpage for supported options and functions.

Easily swallowed by dock (use the --withdrawn option).

Putting wmrack into AfterStep Wharf:
*Wharf WMRack nil Swallow "wmrack" wmrack &


BUGS & CONTACT:
---------------
Please send bug reports or suggestions to ograf@fga.de. Include
a description how the bug can be reproduced plus the vendor and
model of your cdrom and/or soundcard. Also include a debug log
(configure with --with-debug -- this is the default for beta
versions) created with your bug-reproduction-recipe.

Send new styles or style questions to ograf@fga.de


HISTORY:
--------
Basically this thing borrowed much from WorkBone, ascd and asmixer. But in
the progress of work, almost any part that was stolen, has been rewritten,
restructured, and overworked.
