wmrack (1.3-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * changed build-dependency on xutils to libxt-dev because the configure
    script looks for a header in libxt-dev if it can't find xmkmf, and
    xmkmf has been moved to xutils-dev.  I could have changed to
    build-depend on xutils-dev, of course, but this way allows backports
    to sarge.  Thanks to Andreas Metzler for the suggestion. (Closes: #365126).
  * At the advice of Aaron Ucko, I have patched configure (and
    configure.in) to handle the case where X does not need additional
    include or library paths.

wmrack (1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

    inobvious and annoying build-dependencies around---its only used by
    one test in the configure script...sigh).

wmrack (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Note that I am now the upstream maintainer as
    well as the Debian maintainer.  All my debian-specific patches have
    now been merged into the upstream source (as you might expect).
  * Removed the README.Debian, which was not at all wmrack related (except
    insofar as wmrack is one of many applications that use sound).
  * Changed debian/copyright to mention new webpage and maintainer (me).
  * Added hints and longtitle to menu.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules, started using debhelper v3.
  * Rewrote description.
