wmrack (1.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * added missing build-dependency on xutils (grr, this is one of the most
    inobvious and annoying build-dependencies around---its only used by

wmrack (1.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.  Note that I am now the upstream maintainer as
    well as the Debian maintainer.  All my debian-specific patches have
    now been merged into the upstream source (as you might expect).
  * Removed the README.Debian, which was not at all wmrack related (except
    insofar as wmrack is one of many applications that use sound).
  * Changed debian/copyright to mention new webpage and maintainer (me).
  * Added hints and longtitle to menu.
  * Cleaned up debian/rules, started using debhelper v3.
  * Rewrote description.
