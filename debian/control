Description: Combined CD Player + Mixer designed for WindowMaker
 This dockapp combines a CD player and a mixer in one 48x48 window.
 Very efficient on screen real-estate.  Especially handy if you mainly
 want a mixer, and only rarely use a CD player, but want to have one
 around just in case.
 .
 It's designed with WindowMaker in mind, but it works fine with any
 window manager, and can be swallowed by afterstep/fvwm/gnome panel/etc.
