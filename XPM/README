*.style files can be loaded using the -style option of wmrack

You can define your standart style by linking standart.style to
the style of your choice before compilation using:
ln -sf <yourchoice>.style standart.style

cd_mask.xpm is the standart mask of on of the window faces.
led.xpm     are the digits and signs for the cdplayer.

you need for pixmaps (the names must be the name of the XPM):
cdnodisc  (please to not any track +/- buttons)
cdpaused
cdplaying
cdstopped
plus the led.xpm (until now not really needed, the compiletime
                  default will do).

cat all five into one file using for example:
  'cat no.xpm pl.xpm pau.xpm sto.xpm led.xpm >a.style'

If you want to submit new styles to the WMRack distribution, send
them to Heiko Wagner <hwagner@fga.de>.
