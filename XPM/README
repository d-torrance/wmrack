*.style files can be loaded using the -style option of wmrack

You can define your standart style by linking standart.style to
the style of your choice before compilation using:
ln -sf <yourchoice>.style standart.style

cd_mask.xpm    is the standart mask of on of the window faces.
mixer_mask.xpm is the standart mask of the mixer window face.
led.xpm        are the digits and signs for the cdplayer.
mixled.xpm     these are the scales and source buttons of the mixer.
alphaled.xpm   this is a Dot-LED style characterset (uppercase + digits).

you need for pixmaps (the names must be the name of the XPM):
  cdnodisc  (do not include any track +/- buttons)
  cdpaused
  cdplaying
  cdstopped
  mixer
  mixled    (this must be changed because of the recsrc button)
plus (until now not really needed, the compiletime default will do):
  led
  alphaled
cat all eight into one file using for example:
  'cat no.xpm pl.xpm pau.xpm sto.xpm mix.xpm led.xpm mixled.xpm alpha.xpm >a.style'

If you want to submit new styles to the WMRack distribution, send
them to Oliver Graf <ograf@fga.de>.
